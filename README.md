Weekly Planner Based on [Svelte](https://svelte.dev).

A personal weekly planner mostly aimed to gaining more knowledge in Svelte.

## Development

git clone git@github.com:xeptore/weekly-planner.git
cd weekly-planner/
npm i

```sh
npm run dev
```
A development server with hot-reloading will be started at [localhost:5000](http:localhost:5000).

In order to build the app for production release:

This command will trigger the [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) to build the app into the `/public` directory.
